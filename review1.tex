{\color{red} RD: Comment from Silvia, we need to reference her proposal correctly.}
 
 The authors are proposing an addition to RG-F to study the deeply virtual Compton scattering on neutrons (nDVCS) using a deuterium gaseous target. The experimental setup of RG-F, and in particular the BONuS12 radial TPC, is particularly well suited for the detection of the low-momentum spectator proton giving the possibility to study the impact of Fermi motion and final state interactions on nDVCS.
 
 This experiment is planning to use tagged nDVCS ($\gamma^{*} + D \rarr \gamma + p + (n)$), and fully exclusive nDVCS ($\gamma^{*} + D \rarr \gamma + p + n$) events. Although a large difference in the expected statistics between the two channels, their comparison will allow one to better understand systematic uncertainties in the tagged nDVCS analysis. In addition, these proposed measurements will complement and possibly help in the understanding of the impact of Fermi motion and FSI on the analysis results of RG-B.
 
 This proposal demands only one major modification to the foreseen RG-F data taking plans: a highly polarized electron beam. The proponents state in this proposal that the RG-F spokespersons already agreed to allocate the necessary time to perform polarization measurements, therefore this request represents a beneficial addition to the RG-F program, because it will enable not only the analysis of this particular channel but possibly many other analyses.
  
 The current draft is well documented, but we suggest the proponents to better highlight the importance of the nDVCS measurements and the complementarity with respect to RG-B.
 The following comments and questions aim at helping to clarify and improve the proposal. Detailed comments and text corrections in the following section.
 
 
 \section*{General comments}
 
  \begin{itemize}
  
 \item The authors should further develop the significance of the FSI and Fermi motion. What is the constraining power of the expected results over these effects?

{\color{red} RD: we should add the results from the incoherent in the chapter 1 and then make a global statement as requested. }

\item There should be more details  on how this   proposal is a ``companion'' of the RG-B proposal. What does this analysis intend to accomplish differently from RG-B? 
\\ E12-11-003 quote total $8\%$ systematic uncertainties, while in this proposal estimated uncertainties are $20\%$. Do you have a quantitative evaluation on how much improvement this experiment is going to impose over the 12-11-003 experiment?

{\color{red} In our opinion, the discrepencies are mostly linked to the optimism of the authors of the proposals at this
point. Neutron DVCS has been only measured in few instances to this point and the evaluation of systematic 
error bars without data is by nature a complex matter. In any case, we expect the final results of both 
experiments to yield rather similar systematic error bars.}
 
 \item The experiment is planning to run with 5 times less luminosity than the CLAS12 designed luminosity, and hence these runs are expected to have smaller background and, so, larger tracking efficiency in the forward detector. \\
 But during the RG-A and RG-B data taking, the beam current was limited to about 2/3 of the nominal request due to occupancy in the tracking detector higher than expected. Did you consider how much would the loss of statistics impact the expected results? 
 
{\color{red} We do not think it is the place of a run group proposal to reassess the feasability of a proposal running
conditions. This is the job of the ERR organized by JLab, which has been passed for the run group discussed
here (\href{}). Nonetheless, we can say here that the limit in luminosity of the run group is driven by the
RTPC performance and cannot be direcly related to passed performances of the RG-A or B.}

 \item Do Moller electrons represent an issue for the tracking performance? 

{\color{red} Assuming, this is regarding tracking in the RTPC, the answer is no. The electrons do not leave a track in the
RTPC due to the low gain at which it is setup.}

 \item It is not explained why the solenoid will be set at 5 Tesla. Since this proposal aims at measuring the low-momentum spectator proton, one would guess that a lower magnetic field would allow reaching lower momenta. Was this considered?
 
{\color{red} As stated above, we do not believe this run group proposal review is the right place to discuss the specifics of 
choices made previously for the run conditions of the Bonus12 proposal. However, we can say that reducing the 
strength of the magnetic field has little impact on the proton detection threshold, while it worsen the momentum
resolution of the RTPC.}

 \item What is the recoil proton momentum resolution? There is no discussion on the tracking of such low energy protons in the solenoid. How big is the impact of the proton reconstruction resolution on the final results on FSI and Fermi motion?
 \\In the text there is also a remark regarding the fact that the reconstruction with BONuS12 is not yet finalized. We suggest to smoothen the fact that the tracking is not yet included in the CLAS12 framework and to give an estimate on when it will be.
 
{\color{red} The resolution of the RTPC has very little impact on the FSI results because cuts are very wide. For Fermi
motion, a better resolution is always an improvement, but with varied effectiveness. At some point resolution 
improvement has very little impact on errors dominated by other factors.

RD: Please Mohammad answer to the second part.}

 \item In the experimental setup, there is no mention of the Forward Tagger. Did you consider including it? Given that RG-B is running with FT, what will be the impact on the comparison between the two experiments of not including the FT?
 
{\color{red} Indeed a significant portion of the phase space is cut by the abscence of the FT. We feel that it is not a 
critical issue for comparisons with 12-11-003, we can do it only in part of the phase space and still obtain
a meaningful comparison. On the other side, including the FT wuld increase the background in the Bonus 
experiment and cause changes on the beam line that we did not want to ask from the run group as it would imply 
to reassess things validated by their ERR.}

  \item There is no mention of trigger requirements for this measurement. Will you use the same trigger as the BONuS12? Is it just an electron trigger with certain electron momentum range? Please specify.
  
{\color{red} Yes we will use an open electron trigger. (RD: Mohammad can you add something on this?)}

  \item Systematic uncertainties. 
  \begin{itemize}
   \item  It is written that ``normalization and efficiencies [...] cancel out in the asymmetry ratio''. This is true only if the data taking conditions do not change in time, i.e. all the runs considered have very similar conditions.

{\color{red} ???}

   \item There is a mention of non exclusive $\pi^0$ background. What do you mean by ``non exclusive''? What about the exclusive production of $\pi^0$ with either a missing photon or merged photons? Since this is the major background contribution for the e-p data, could you elaborate more on this source of background?

{\color{red} ???}

   \item Last paragraph of page 25. Varying the exclusivity cuts means that you change the amount of signal that you accept, therefore the obtained uncertainty also contains a statistical part. Was this taken into account?

{\color{red} The effect of statistics is actually very small. Indeed, a major part of the two samples are common and 
therefore do not vary like independent events (which is assumed for statistical error bar evaluation). 
Moreover, tightening the cuts removes portions of good and bad events, which 
also affects the corrections applied to remove the backgrounds. At the end, we use values from the CLAS eg6
experience since it is the closest in nature to what is proposed here. There, the study was performed fully
by re-evluating all the corrections for each cut choices.}

   \item Fit sensitivity. What function was used? How this dependence of the binning was evaluated? Did you change the functional form?

{\color{red} Same as above, we did not perform this study here, but reused the results of the eg6 analysis.}

\section*{Detailed comments} 

{\color{red}RD: Mohammad can you go through these?}

 \begin{itemize}
 
  \item Introduction. Line 5. Change ``motion of partons'' in ``longitudinal motion of partons''.
  
  \item Chapter 1. Avoid technical jargon or it needs to be introduced.
  
  \item Page 9, line 9. ``proposal is enhance'' \rarr ``proposal is to enhance''.

    \item  Page 9 $2^{nd}$ paragraph, A question on the following sentence  ``However, the impact of the uncertain initial state and the final state interactions on the integration of these data in global fits remain unclear.'' \\

  \item Page 10, line 1. ``plagued'' \rarr ``affected''.
  
  \item Page 10, line 6. ``... the sin component of the beam spin asymmetry''. The BSA is not yet introduced, therefore is jargon to discuss the sin component.
  
  \item Page 10. Eq 1.1 contains Compton form factors that aren't mentioned yet. Again, a non super expert reader may be lost.
  
%   \item Page 10. Eq 1.3. Is $d\varphi$ needed?
  
  \item Pege 12 Formulas (1.7), (1.8) and (1.9) \\
  -Typo: $cos$ with $s_{n}$ coefficients should be $sin$.
  \item Page12 $1^{st}$ line:  ``are called Fourier coefficients and they depend...'' \\
  might be better to change ``are called Fourier coefficients. They depend...''
  
  \item Page 12. After Eq 1.12, expand on why you want to measure the BSA.
  
  \item Page 13. ``... uncertainties in detection''. Unclear, please rephrase.
  
  \item Page 13. Line 10. ``... published data is ...'' \rarr ``published data are...''
  
  \item Page 14. Line 1. ``... helping with nuclear effects'' \rarr ``... helping in the understanding of the nuclear effects''.
  
  \item Page 14 $3^{rd}$ paragraph: ``wesee calculation''\\
  - A typo ``we see calculation...''
  
  \item Page 14 $3^{rd}$ paragraph: ``At low recoil momentum and
backwards spectator angle, the FSIs are negligible, whereas at high momenta perpendicular
to the momentum transfer, FSIs are maximized'' \\ 
  - This doesn't seem to be consistent with Fig1.5 that you are quoting. It seems labels in the left plot of Fig. 1.5 are wrong. Probably it needs to be changed: $0^{\circ}\rightarrow 180^{\circ}$, $180^{\circ}\rightarrow 90^{\circ}$, $90^{\circ}\rightarrow 0^{\circ}$.\\
  - PWIA not defined.
  
  \item What is your intention about large and small FSI regions. \\
  - Fig. 3.10 shows bins with different momentum and angles, but it is not clear what you are planning to do in order to understand better FSI and initial motions of nucleons in the deuterium (or nuclei).
  
  \item Page 16 $2^{nd}$ paragraph: ``and eg6 (E08-024)experiments'' \\
  - Add space between (E08-024) and experiments.
  
  \item Page 17 $3^{rd}$ paragraph ``The charged particle identification in the forward detector is achieved by utilizing the combination of the HTCC, LTCC and TOF arrays with the tracking information from the Drift Chambers.'' \\
- LTCC is present only in four sectors, and a proper gas mixture is only in one sector. Most of charged particle identification doesn't use LTCC. You might skip LTCC, or otherwise if for completeness you want to include it, then you might want to add RICH as well.


\item In the summary page, ``\textit{ The first channel will enrich our knowledge about the partonic structure of the quasi-free neutrons, while the fully exclusive neutron DVCS measurement will be a golden data set to understand the Fermi motion and final state interaction effects on the measured DVCS beam-
spin asymmetries.''}\\
- It was not clear how exactly you are going to learn more about FSI and Fermi motions with proposed measurements. See also the General remarks.
