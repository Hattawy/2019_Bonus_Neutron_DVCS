\section{Monte-Carlo Simulation}
An event generator for DVCS/BH and exclusive $\pi^0$ electroproduction on the 
neutron inside a deuterium target has been developed \cite{ahmed}. The DVCS 
amplitude is calculated according to the BKM formalism \cite{Belitsky:2001ns}, 
while the GPDs have been taken from the standard CLAS DVCS generator 
\cite{PhysRevD.60.094017,Guidal:2004nd}.  The Fermi-motion distribution is 
calculated with the Paris potential \cite{PhysRevC.21.861}.

The output of the event generator was fed through CLAS12 official simulation 
and reconstruction chain, to simulate the acceptance and resolutions of 
electrons and photons in the Forward Detector. Final state neutrons being 
detected in the central detector of CLAS12, and the final state recoiling 
protons in the BONuS12 RTPC. 

Figures~\ref{e_th_p},~\ref{g_th_p}, and~\ref{n_th_p} show $\theta$ as a 
function of momentum in the lab frame for, respectively, the electron, the 
photon and the neutron. The two panels of Fig.~\ref{n_th} are one-dimensional 
plots, showing, respectively, the momentum and the polar angle of the recoil 
neutron. As expected, the electron and the photon are mostly emitted at forward 
angles, while the recoil neutron is going at backwards angles.
