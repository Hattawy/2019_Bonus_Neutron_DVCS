Inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments have been instrumental in 
advancing our understanding of the QCD structure of nucleons in the past. More
recently, hard exclusive experiments such as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and 
Deeply Virtual Meson Production (DVMP) have provided important new probes that 
allows us to explore both the motion of partons and their transverse 
spatial structure in nucleons through the generalized parton distribution (GPD) framework.  
The GPDs correspond to the coherence between quantum 
states of different (or same) helicity, longitudinal momentum, and transverse 
position. In an impact parameter space, they can be interpreted as a 
distribution in the transverse plane of partons carrying a certain longitudinal 
momentum~\cite{Burkardt-2000,Diehl-2002,Belitsky-2002}. A crucial feature of 
GPDs is the access to the transverse position of partons which, combined with 
their longitudinal momentum, leads to the total angular momentum of 
partons~\cite{Burkardt-2005}. This information is not accessible to inclusive 
DIS which measures probability amplitudes in the longitudinal plane. \\

A high luminosity facility such as Jefferson Lab offers a unique opportunity to 
map out the three-dimensional quark and gluon structure of nucleons and nuclei.
Considered as one of the main motivations for the JLab 12 GeV upgrade, while 
most of submitted proposals to JLab Program Advisory Committee (PAC) have 
focused on studies of the 3D proton or deuterium structure, we propose here to 
extend the measurements to quasi-free neutrons in deuterium with the BONuS12 
experiment. Measurements on the neutron are critical in the Jefferson Lab GPD 
program for two reasons, first as neutrons offer the only access to flavor 
decomposition for GPDs, second because of the importance of the $E$ GPD to 
measure the Ji sum rule~\cite{Ji:1996ek,Leader:2013jra}.

Recent results from CLAS on incoherent DVCS from a $^4$He target have shown that
even in light nuclei, large nuclear effects can be observed~\cite{Hattawy:2018liu}.
As this measurement shows a deviation of $\approx 30$\% for the beam spin asymmetry (BSA)
of DVCS of bound protons in helium, one can assume that a sizable correction 
will be necessary in the neutron case as well. This could be particularly 
dramatic as the BSA expected on neutrons are rather small. We propose here to 
transpose the methods developed for BONuS12 for PDF measurements~\cite{bonus12} 
to the GPDs. In particular, we are looking how the initial state and the 
break-up of the deuterium might affect the measured BSA. The upcoming Run group 
F, scheduled for February-April 2020, is the perfect occasion to gather data on 
this topic, which can be done with the simple addition of beam polarization to 
the setting of the run group!
